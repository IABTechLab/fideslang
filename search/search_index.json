This taxonomy provides an interoperable standard designed to assist businesses in navigating the complex landscape of global privacy regulations. In collaboration with Ethyca , IAB Tech Lab received a donation of Fideslang to accelerate the development of privacy standards within the ad tech industry. Fideslang represents five years of dedicated work aimed at enhancing data privacy practices by creating a universal language that bridges the gap between legal and development teams. This innovation aligns seamlessly with the IAB Tech Lab's Privacy Taxonomy Project, a key initiative of the Privacy Implementation & Accountability Task Force. The project aims to create a standardized privacy taxonomy that enables businesses to effectively manage their data privacy compliance and communicate privacy information more clearly across the industry. The Privacy Taxonomy is uniquely tailored to the evolving landscape of data protection. Building on the foundation of Fideslang, the taxonomy aims to set a new standard for how privacy information is conveyed across the digital advertising ecosystem. The Privacy Taxonomy is open for public comment until October 5th, 2024. Industry stakeholders are encouraged to review and provide feedback at support@iabtechlab.com . Taxonomy Explorer The IAB Tech Lab Privacy Taxonomy is composed of three main classification groups: Data Elements, Data Uses, and Data Subjects. These groups work together to describe the data types, purposes of use, and data owners (subjects) of data being processed for privacy and governance purposes. Below, you can explore the primary components of the taxonomy. To learn more about the taxonomy's structure read the explanation below Data Elements Data Uses Data Subjects Fideslang Privacy Taxonomy Explained 1. Data Elements Data Elements are labels to describe the type of data processed by your business and technology systems. Data Categories are hierarchical with natural inheritance, meaning you can label data coarsely with a high-level category (e.g. user.contact data), or you can tag it with greater precision using subcategories (e.g. user.contact.email data). This provides a standard way to tag data in databases, which can assist with data privacy operations (e.g. data mapping, DSRs, contracts, disclosures, consent/opt-out, etc.). The data element, when clear under the applicable law, aligns with categories specified in US data privacy laws (e.g., CCPA, CPA). 2. Data Uses Data Uses are labels that describe how, or for what purpose(s) you are using data. You may think of these as analogous to Purpose of Processing in such documents as a RoPA (Record of Processing Activities). Data Uses are also hierarchical with natural inheritance, meaning you can easily describe what you're using data for either coarsely (e.g. provide.service.operations) or with more precision using subcategories (e.g. provide.service.operations.support.optimization). The top-level labels create standard buckets to categorize data uses into: (1) necessary, (2) operational, (3) analytics, (4) advertising and marketing, and (5) disclosure. 3. Data Subjects Data Subjects describes the owner or individual that the data being processed describes, examples might be a customer, or an employee. In many systems a generic user label may be sufficient, however the taxonomy is intended to provide greater control through specificity where needed for governance. Examples of this are: consumer househould employee Laws Triggered For data categories and data uses, these are mapped to the major laws they trigger and the sensitivity that a given data category may obtain based on processing under a given framework. IAB Frameworks The Fideslang taxonomy automatically cross-references all data uses to the IAB TCF and IAB MSPA frameworks, meaning that if you tag a data use such as advertising_marketing.first_party.targeted , it will automatically inherit the classification of \"First Party Advertising\" as defined by 1.33ii of the MSPA. Sensitivity Matrix When using the Privacy Taxonomy, you may assign sensitivity on a scale of 1-3 to given data categories. With 1 not being sensitive and 3 being sensitive as determined by applicable law. You should complete this sensitivity matrix based on your businesses internal policies and risk management. Sensitivity Matrix scoring: 1 = no; 2 = no; unless combined with another non-sensitive data point that makes the combined data elements sensitive -e.g, account log-in + password/credentials to access the account 3 = yes, per se sensitive as determined by applicable law -e.g. citizenship status, racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, data relating to children, etc. Extensibility and Interoperability The Privacy Taxonomy is designed to support common privacy compliance regulations and standards out of the box, these include CCPA, MSPA, etc. You can extend the taxonomy to support your system needs. If you do this, we recommend extending from the existing class structures to ensure interoperability inside and outside your organization. If you have suggestions for missing classifications or concepts, please submit them for addition. Public Comment Privacy Taxonomy is open for public comment until October 5th, 2024.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC- licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees ======================================================================= Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. Section 1 -- Definitions. a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 -- Scope. a. License grant. 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) (4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 -- License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 -- Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 -- Scope. a. License grant. 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) (4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 -- License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. b.

WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 -- Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

This page describes the syntax of the language in more detail to help better interpret Fides whether you're authoring or reading. The Fides language is designed to be relatively easy for anyone to read and write. The primary objective is to translate complex privacy compliance concepts into an approachable syntax, it's for this reason Fides is entirely written as YAML configurations. YAML - Building Block of Fides Fides Taxonomy The Fides language is intentionally simple. To assure this, Fides declarations use predefined primitives (e.g. data categories) that are used when describing your datasets, systems, policies, etc. These predefined primitives exist as part of the Fides taxonomy which is maintained in your Fides server so they can be consistently used across your organization's development team. You can learn more about the taxonomy structure and how to extend it in the taxonomy guide . Dot Notation and Snake_Case To make writing and reading Fides language as easy for humans as possible, declarations from the privacy taxonomy use dot notation for the keys and use snake_case compound labels. For example, to describe a field in a database as contact information relating to a user, you can write its data category as: 1 2 # This declares that the contact data is about a given user: user.contact If we require greater specificity, we could declare the contact type as a phone number by using a more specific sub-category: 1 2 3 # This declares that the is data about a given user, # and is from the contact category and of type phone number. user.contact.phone_number Key-Value The key-value is YAML, and Fides', basic building block. Every item in a Fides YAML document is a member of at least one dictionary. The key is always a string . The value is a scalar so that it can be any datatype. So the value can be a string , a number , or another dictionary - most commonly in Fides, this will be a string that may provide a description or a pointer to a reference object in the taxonomy. If we use the example of a user's contact email, to correctly declare this in valid Fides YAML as part of a Dataset, it would be: 1 2 3 4 5 6 fields : # Group of fields in the dataset. - name : email description : User's Email data_categories : # Data category label(s) to assign field. - user.contact.email - user.account.contact.email The key for each key-value pair determines what value types are valid (for example, a resource type such as data_categories must use values from the Data Categories taxonomy), but many keys accept arbitrary strings as descriptive labels. Finally, as you see in the example above, keys such as data_categories accept a list of values for multi-labeling. In this case, the field email has been assigned the value user contact email as well as account-related contact email , indicating that it may be either of those categories when used. Character Encoding Fides configuration files must always be UTF-8 encoded. While the delimiters of the language are all ASCII characters, Fides accepts non-ASCII characters in key-values, comments, and string values.","title":"Fides Configuration Syntax"},{"location":"syntax/#fides-configuration-syntax","text":"Other pages in this language section describe various concepts and resources that appear in the Fides language.

This is a database-agnostic way to annotate privacy declarations. 1 2 3 4 5 organization |-> system |-> ** dataset ** |-> collections |-> fields The schema is represented as a set of \"collections\" (tables) that contain \"fields\" (columns). These can also be arbitrarily nested to handle document-type databases (e.g., NoSQL or S3). At each level -- Dataset, collection, and field, you can assign one or more Data Categories. The Categories declared at each child level are additive. You use your Datasets by adding them to Systems. A System can contain any number of Datasets, and a Dataset can be added to any number of Systems. When a dataset is referenced by a system, all applicable data categories set on the dataset are treated as part of the system. If a Dataset is not referenced by a System, a warning is surfaced denoting an orphan dataset exists. Datasets cannot contain other Datasets.

These are most heavily used by the System and Dataset resources, where you can assign one or more data categories to each field. Object Structure fides_key constrained string A string token that uniquely identifies this Data Category. The value is a dot-separated concatenation of the fides_key values of the resource's ancestors plus a final element for this resource: grandparent.parent.this_data_category The final element ( this_data_category ) may only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ( [A-Za-z0-9_.-] ). The dot character is reserved as a separator. name string A UI-friendly label for the Data Category. description string A human-readable description of the Data Category. parent_key string The fides key of the Data Category's parent. organization_fides_key string default: default_organization The fides key of the organization to which this Data Category belongs. Extensibility and interoperability Data Categories in the taxonomy are designed to support common privacy regulations and standards out of the box, these include GDPR, CCPA, LGPD and ISO 19944. You can extend the taxonomy to support your system needs. If you do this, we recommend extending from the existing class structures to ensure interoperability inside and outside your organization. If you have suggestions for core classes that should ship with the taxonomy, please submit your requests here . Top Level Data Categories There are two top-level categories: Label Parent Key Description system - Data unique to, and under control of the system. user - Data related to the user of the system. For each top level category there can be multiple subcategories that provide richer context.

Summary of Taxonomy Classification Groups 1. Data Categories Data Categories are labels to describe the type of data processed by your software. These are most heavily used by the System and Dataset resources, where you can assign one or more data categories to each field. Data Categories are hierarchical with natural inheritance, meaning you can classify data coarsely with a high-level category (e.g. user.contact data), or you can classify it with greater precision using subcategories (e.g. user.contact.email data). Learn more about Data Categories in the taxonomy reference now . 2. Data Uses Data Uses are labels that describe how, or for what purpose(s) a component of your system is using data. Data Uses are also hierarchical with natural inheritance, meaning you can easily describe what you're using data for either coarsely (e.g. provide.service.operations ) or with more precision using subcategories (e.g. provide.service.operations.support.optimization ). Learn more about Data Uses in the taxonomy reference now . 3. Data Subjects Data Subject is a label commonly used in the regulatory world to describe the users of a system whose data is being processed. In many systems a generic user label may be sufficient, however, Fides language is intended to provide greater control through specificity where needed. Examples of this are: anonymous_user employee customer patient next_of_kin Learn more about Data Subjects in the taxonomy reference now . Extensibility & interoperability The Fides language is designed to support common privacy compliance regulations and standards out of the box, these include GDPR, CCPA, LGPD and ISO 19944. You can extend the taxonomy to support your organization's needs. If you do this, we recommend extending from the existing categories to ensure interoperability inside and outside your organization.","title":"Fides Taxonomy"},{"location":"taxonomy/overview/#fides-taxonomy","text":"The Fides taxonomy contains four classification groups that are used together to easily describe all of the data types and associated processing behaviors of an entire tech stack; both the application and its data storage.","title":"Fides Taxonomy"},{"location":"taxonomy/overview/#summary-of-taxonomy-classification-groups","text":"","title":"Summary of Taxonomy Classification Groups"},{"location":"taxonomy/overview/#1-data-categories","text":"Data Categories are labels to describe the type of data processed by your software.
